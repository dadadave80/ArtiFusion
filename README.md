# ArtiFusion: Tokenbound NFT Launchpad

Welcome to **ArtiFusion**, an innovative platform built for the [ShapeCraft Hackathon](https://shape.network/shapecraft#overview)!

## Overview
ArtiFusion is a tokenbound NFT launchpad that empowers creators and collectors to launch and trade AI-powered NFT collections with a unique twist:

- **Prompt or Upload**: Users can start a new NFT collection by either prompting an AI or uploading the first image.
- **AI-Driven Minting**: After the initial image, all subsequent mint images in the collection are generated by AI, inspired by the original user-provided image.
- **No-Loss Auction Marketplace**: Collections launched on ArtiFusion can be sold in a no-loss auction format, ensuring fair and engaging trading experiences for all participants.

## Features
- **Tokenbound NFTs**: Each NFT is linked to its own smart contract wallet, unlocking new composability and utility.
- **AI-Powered Art Generation**: Seamlessly integrate user creativity with generative AI to produce evolving NFT collections.
- **Creator-Friendly Launchpad**: Simple, intuitive interface for launching new collections and managing sales.
- **No-Loss Auctions**: Innovative auction mechanism where participants can bid without risk of losing their funds if they don't win.

## How It Works
1. **Create a Collection**: Start by uploading an image or providing an AI prompt.
2. **Minting Process**: The AI generates new images for each mint, based on the original image or prompt.
3. **Auction & Trade**: List your NFTs in the no-loss auction marketplace. Collectors can participate and win NFTs without risking their bids.
